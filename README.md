# Lessons Learned
This was a simple HTML, JavaScript, and CSS project to learn the basics of JavaScript functions, logic, and manipulating the DOM. The trickiest parts for me at this early stage of my coding journey were figuring out how to create a random number between 1 and 3, and check the inputted name was both capitalised and a letter.
